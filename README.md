# Monster Hunter 5000

This is a game that was created by me in 2012 when I was 17 to apply for a $25k scholarship at Full Sail University. I won the scholarship. It was built in the Unity 3D Game Engine using C# scripts. I didnâ€™t know anything about programming at the time.
I understand it is not packaged 100% professionally, but it is just how I submitted it. Good Memories. <3 

If you pull download the package and click on the .exe, you can play the full game.


## Installation & Play

You may need to move the items from the MOVE_TO_ROOT Folder to the root folder in order to play. 

```bash
1) Download Packaged Contents
2) Move contents from "MOVE_TO_ROOT" folder to root folder.
3) Run the .exe file to play.
4) Have Fun! :-)
```
